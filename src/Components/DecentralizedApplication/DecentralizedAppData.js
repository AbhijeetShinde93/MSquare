    points_subcontent:
      "Because dApps are decentralized, rather than based on standard client/server networks, no single node controls all the transactions or records. In other words, there is no single point of failure that can crash or sabotage the whole app. As a result, dApps are both more stable and safer than traditional apps, do not need downtime and provide constant access.",

Once the root cause on a business level has been identified, a technical analysis is conducted to map out how blockchain can help resolve the problem, and what platform should be used for the purpose.
