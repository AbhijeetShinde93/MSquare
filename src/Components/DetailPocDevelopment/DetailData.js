At the same time, the PoC provides you with a genuine understanding of the business case for your project and helps you get timely feedback from stakeholders.",

So if your PoC is not feasible you will avoid the pitfalls of developing a full-scale project that is unlikely to gain traction or presents significant challenges and problems.",

Creating a PoC on the other hand helps you determine whether the choice of methods, data, and tools or the scope of the project is realistic. These are some of the immediate benefits of blockchain PoC development. Spending a relatively small amount of time and resources on proving a concept beforehand can lead to significant adoption of the technology down the line. Not to mention that it can also produce a greater return on investment.",
